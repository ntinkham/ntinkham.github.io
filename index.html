				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p> Hi! My name is Nicole Tinkham and I am a senior Psychology major at USC. Fun fact: I am originally from Warren, Ohio, and I have two cats (Chloe and Pepper). </p>
				<p class="hidden" id="see-more"> Two things I am very passionate about are exercise and working with kids. Right now, I am able to pursure both of these passions through my job as a gymnastics coach. Coaching has taught me a lot about patience and communication, and these are skills I will be able to take with me anywhere I go. </p>

				<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
				<p> As of now, I am on track to graduate in December. My plan after that is to take a gap year to work and travel abroad before applying for graduate school. </p>
				<p class="hidden" id="see-again"> I would eventually like to get my Ed.S. in school counseling. I then want to use this to pursue a career as a middle or high school counselor. </p>
